# WebappStorybook

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This won't provide much use for the sake of this project currently, however, as we are building components that are presentation only and are only used in storybook.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Storybook

The purpose of this project is to build a component library of presentational components that can be used in webapp. To run storybook locally, run `yarn run storybook`.
