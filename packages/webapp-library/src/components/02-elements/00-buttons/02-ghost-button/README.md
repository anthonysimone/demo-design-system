## Implementation Details

This mixin will handle all variations of the primary button style. It can be used on any kind of appropriate elements that need to be styled as such, like `<button>`, `<a>`, and `<input>`. However, do *not* use this mixin on `<span>` elements, or other elements that aren't intended to be clicked. The theming will work, but you will be building an inaccessibly component.
